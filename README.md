  In an elementary school, a mixture of equal amounts of nuts and dried fruit is provided during lunch.  Suppose that the number of calories in each pound of nuts is 0.70 times the number of calories in each pound of dried fruit.  Write a program that prompts the user to input the number of students in the elementary school, the number of calories required for each student from the mixture, and the number of calories in each pound of nuts.  The program outputs the amount of nuts and dried fruit needed for the students.  (For simplicity, assume that each student requires the same amount of calories.)
