  A room has one door, two windows, and a built-in bookshelf and it needs to be painted.  Suppose that one gallon of paint can paint 120 square feet.  Write a program that prompts the user to input the lengths and widths of the door, each window, the bookshelf; and the length, width, and height of the room (in feet).  The program outputs the amount of paint needed to paint the walls of the room.

Chapter 2 - #28
  In an elementary school, a mixture of equal amounts of nuts and dried fruit is provided during lunch.  Suppose that the number of calories in each pound of nuts is 0.70 times the number of calories in each pound of dried fruit.  Write a program that prompts the user to input the number of students in the elementary school, the number of calories required for each student from the mixture, and the number of calories in each pound of nuts.  The program outputs the amount of nuts and dried fruit needed for the students.  (For simplicity, assume that each student requires the same amount of calories.)
